# Ecommerce React Coding Test for Krypto

## Overview

This project was the continuation of the repository shared: [Ecommerce-boilerplate](https://github.com/gurukishore111/Ecommerce-boilerplate) web app.

What did I do?

An eCommerce application was implemented, Mostly the front-end part. The CSS and Framework used was styled using styled-components and the framework used was react.

## Description of the Project

Description of all the application functionalities

- Login

In order to be able to logged in securely. A user will have to make sure he is required to give correct username and password.

    Sample Username: user1 

    Sample Password: pass1

- Display of products

The Landing page is a grid of products, the images and all the information are populated by the `db.json` provided in the boiler plate.

- Registration

There is a link in the Registration page that takes you to a registration page, where certain credentials are asked. A new user is registered

- Single Product Display

Clicking on the Title of the Product takes you to a new page where only 1 product, with description and various other info about the product is seen.

## Improvements Possible
- Are there any improvements I could make to my submission?
-JWT 

JWT authentication is a token-based stateless authentication mechanism. Server wouldn't need to completely rely on a data store

-Redux

Redux can be used as a data store for any UI layer, Makes the wesite more functional in real time without the client server interaction.

-Auth and Perms

Permissions and Admin Permission/access, making the website more secur/safe and accessible in real world scenarios

-UI-UX and Minor Feataures

Smoother UI-Ux with animation, salient features like "Stock Left" etc can be added in this web application.
## No Time limit Solution 
- What would you do differently if I were allocated more time?
-Functional Cart

User could add and remove products in real time, and the total amount would e generated as per the cart, and its items.

-Register 

Registration would have been fully functional, ale to create new user profiles, that can be further used later.

-Payment Gateway

Would have added a dummy payment gateway, to simulate real life scenario.

-Single Product Display

Would have used the same js file to populate single Products with the same styling, It would have made the website more dynamic and user friendly.

## How should the application work?

The user of this react application should be able to view all the products. The application has this workflow

1. Login/register functionality.
2. Users can add the products to the cart page
3. Users can see every product indiviaually
4. Users can proceed to pay.
